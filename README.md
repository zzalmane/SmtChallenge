# Description
We neeed to developp a service with hight load, a possible solution will be to use reactive programming aproach using Webflux for Spring boot.
Then we will have a non-blocking API that can be faster with an important amount of concurrent users, the cost will also be cheaper.

With this approach we have to have in mind that all our code must be non-blocking, including reactive logging.
